## Functionality
This is a side project I was making during boot-camp. It will be updated with react, but for the time being, it was a way to creatively express myself while in bootcamp outside of the coursework we were doing.

## Premise
You are a police detective in 1920's America trying to uncover a secret underground drug ring, but you dont know how deep this hole goes...

## Code
Currently made with JavaScript and HTML5/CSS, it uses LocalStorage to store states that preserve the current information in the game. Additionally, it has built in commands such as search, use etc. that are akin to old computer text-based adventure games. All made myself, not using any premade "command" engines.
