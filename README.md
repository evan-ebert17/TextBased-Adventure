## Purpose  
This is a side project I was making during boot-camp. It was a way to creatively express myself while in bootcamp outside of the coursework we were doing. Now that I have graduated the course, I have updated the game with more content and intend to finish it eventually, but the first segment of the game is playable!

## Features 
Classic Text Based Adventure Game mechanics, such as "examine", look, go left etc. and a story about a 1920's mystery.

## Premise  
You are a police detective in 1920's America trying to uncover a secret underground drug ring, but you dont know how deep this hole goes...

## Technologies-Used  
Currently made with JavaScript and HTML5/CSS.

## Installation  
There is no need to install this application for use, because it is hosted at the links provided above. However, for code inspection or etc, if you have SSH Keys linked, you can simple use your terminal and clone the repo down, otherwise, the typical zip.

## Usage  
Inside the game, there are a multitude of functions, such as the saving mechanic, which saves your game into localstorage or loads it based on the former. There are traditional tba commands such as go left, go right, inspect, examine, but there are also new inclusions such as the inventory and map w/ character icon to indicate your location. type "HELP" for more commands or general inquiries about further functions of the game.
